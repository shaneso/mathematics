# Mathematics

If intellectual curiosity, professional pride, and ambition are the
dominant incentives to research, then assuredly no one has a
fairer chance of satisfying them than a mathematician. His subject
is the most curious of all—there is none in which truth plays such
odd pranks. It has the most elaborate and the most fascinating
technique, and gives unrivalled openings for the display of sheer
professional skill. Finally, as history proves abundantly,
mathematical achievement, whatever its intrinsic worth, is the
most enduring of all.

— G. H. Hardy, A Mathematician's Apology
